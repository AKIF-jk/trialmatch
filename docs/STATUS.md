# Project Status

Read this first, then `docs/PLAN.md`. Update this file at the end of every phase or work session, and commit and push it.

**Last updated:** 2026-11-01
**Current phase:** Phase 0 is done. Phase 1 (data and split) has not started. The delta source build is done.
**Deadline:** November 10, 2026, plus a 2-hour grace period. Target submission is November 9.

## Next Steps

1. Start Phase 1 as written in `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Accounts And Locations

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| GitHub repo | `AKIF-jk/trialmatch` (private until submission) |
| Kaggle user | `akifjawad` |
| Source kernel | `akifjawad/trialmatch-src` (version 2 at commit `3cc217d`) |
| Hugging Face user | `AkifJK` |
| Dataset revision | `ncbi/TrialGPT-Criterion-Annotations` at `1cfcafde94a1560a33b4addc1638664fe28fc059` |
| GPU quota | 30 h/week, resets November 7, 00:00 UTC. About 1.4 min used on November 1. |

## Known Constraints

- **Local machine:** 7 GB RAM and about 1.7 GB free disk. Do not install PyTorch or download models locally.
- **Kaggle attachments:** `kernelDataSources` is silently dropped by the MCP server. Pass outputs between kernels through signed output URLs from `list_notebook_session_output`. Fetch a fresh URL for each job, because their lifetime is unknown.
- **Delta source build:** `python3 tools/build_kernel.py src --base-url URL --base-commit SHA` inlines only files that differ from `SHA`. `URL` is the `src.tar.gz` output URL of the previous source kernel version, and `SHA` is the commit that version was built from (version 2 is `3cc217d`). The kernel asserts the base tree hash and the new tree hash. Tested locally for change, delete and wrong-base cases. Not yet run on Kaggle. Without the flags, the build inlines every file.
- **Kaggle slugs:** Create a kernel with `newTitle`. Update one with `slug: "akifjawad/<name>"`.
- **Blocked actions:** A secret gist upload and `gh repo create` were blocked by the permission classifier. Do not route around a block. Tell the user and let them decide.
- **Hugging Face writes:** The connector and plugin tools are read-only. Use `~/.local/bin/hf`, which is logged in as `AkifJK` and passed a private create, upload and read-back test. The test repo has been deleted.
- **Library pin:** Stay on transformers 5.16.1. Use `cache.crop(-n)`, because positive crop lengths are removed in 5.18.
- **Generation settings:** Always pass `do_sample=False`, `repetition_penalty=1.0`, `temperature=None`, `top_p=None`, `top_k=None`. The model defaults are sampling settings.
- **Test set:** Do not load or inspect it before Phase 7. It runs once, from a tagged commit.

## Open Items For The User

- Ask the instructor whether the rubric is out of 100 or 135. The heading and the table disagree.
- Before Phase 6: confirm the HF email is verified. The two existing Spaces use `cpu-basic`, so both free ZeroGPU slots should be available.

## Kernels In Flight

None.
